    "Profile_Pic": "assets/images/Orange.jpg",
    "About":
        "An orange has a tough shiny orange skin that holds acid in outside layer. Inside, the fruit is divided into segments, which have thin tough skins that hold together many little sections with juice inside. There are usually ten segments in an orange, but sometimes there are more or less. Inside each segment of most types of orange there are seeds called pips. Orange trees can be grown from pips, but some types of orange trees can only be grown from cuttings (a piece cut off a tree and made to grow roots). The segments and the skin are separated by white stringy fibrous material called pith. In most types of oranges, the skin can be peeled off the pith, and the segments can be pulled apart with the fingers to be eaten. In some oranges it is hard to take the skin off. Orange skin is often called orange peel",

    "Profile_Pic": "assets/images/Cherry.jpg",
    "About":
        "Three types of cherries are mainly grown for their fruit: sweet cherries, sour cherries, and, grown to a much smaller extent, the dukes, which are crosses of sweet and sour cherries. Sweet cherry trees are large and rather upright, attaining heights up to 11 metres (36 feet). The fruit is a fleshy drupe (stone fruit) that is generally heart-shaped to nearly globular, about 2 cm (1 inch) in diameter, and varies in colour from yellow through red to nearly black. The acid content of the sweet cherry is low. The higher acid content of the sour cherry produces its characteristic tart flavour. Sour cherry trees are smaller, rarely over 5 metres (16 feet) in height. The fruit is round to oblate in shape, is generally dark red in colour, and has so much acid that it is not appealing for eating fresh. The duke cherries are intermediate in both tree and fruit characteristics. The fruits of all varieties provide vitamin A and small amounts of such minerals as calcium and phosphorus.",

    "Name": "Strawberry",
    "Example": "The strawberry harvest failed because of the drought.",
    "Profile_Pic": "assets/images/Strawberry.jpg",
    "About":
        "Strawberries are low-growing herbaceous plants with a fibrous root system and a crown from which arise basal leaves. The leaves are compound, typically with three leaflets, sawtooth-edged, and usually hairy. The flowers, generally white, rarely reddish, are borne in small clusters on slender stalks arising, like the surface-creeping stems, from the axils of the leaves. As a plant ages, the root system becomes woody, and the “mother” crown sends out runners (e.g., stolons) that touch ground and root, thus enlarging the plant vegetatively.",

    "Profile_Pic": "assets/images/Nectarine.jpg",
    "About":
        "Nectarines are a smooth-fleshed stone fruit that are a close relative to the peach. In fact, nectarines are in the same family, Rosaceae, and are cultivars of peaches, possessing a recessive gene that gives them bald skin, firmer flesh, and a denser flavor. Both fruits have either clingstones or freestones, meaning the pits either stay close to the flesh of the fruit or fall out easily, making slicing less messy. Nectarines can be eaten raw, and since the peel isn't fuzzy, are often eaten out of hand with the center pit discarded (no peeling required). They tend to be slightly higher in price than peaches but comparable.",

    "About":
        "Blueberries are named for their color. Because of their sweet and tart flavor and their nearly seedless nature, blueberries are a hugely popular fruit. For centuries, people could only grow and harvest blueberries in small numbers. However, at the turn of the 20th century, they were domesticated and brought to the national market. Blueberries can now be eaten all year long as healthy, nutritious treats.",
